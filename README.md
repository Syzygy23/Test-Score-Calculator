# Test-Score-Calculator
An LC3 Program that takes 5 numbers between 0 and 100, and displays the biggest number, smallest number, and average

The program takes five 3 digit numbers. Each digit is automatically converted to Hexadecimal for the sake of maximum/minimum comparisons and calculating the sum to be used for average. If an invalid character is detected, the program sends an error message. Once all the calculations are made, the hexidecimal values are converted back to ASCII for output.
